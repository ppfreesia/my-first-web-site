<h2>What does a software engineer do?</h2>
<p>Software engineers are skilled IT professionals who create a variety of software applications and networking systems using programming languages. They typically work for <a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-Software-Engineering-jobs.html?from=careerguide-autohyperlink-en-US">software engineering</a> firms, large corporations or production companies to help with product development.
